To ensure consistent formatting across files, [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) is used alongside [Eslint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint).

The configuration also includes [eslint-config-prettier](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier) to prevent conflicts between ESlint and Prettier rules.

## Features
